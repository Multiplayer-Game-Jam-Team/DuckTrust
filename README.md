## Gameplay

2 Ducks are stuck on an unbalanced Lilly pad. You must even out each others weight and stay balanced!

Various objects will be landing on your Lilly pad and throwing you both off balance. You need to waddle over and bump the objects off of the Lilly pad while your partner acts as your counter balance! ‚öñÔ∏è

You can use your special key and turn your duck to stone! üóø

This will increase your weight, and give your partner more time to go bump off some items!
